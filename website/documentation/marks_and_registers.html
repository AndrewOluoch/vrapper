<h2>Marks and Registers</h2>

<h3>Marks</h3>
<p>Any position in the text may be marked using 'm&lt;x&gt;' where &lt;x&gt; is a
character from a-z. You can jump to a mark with `x and to the begin of
the line where the mark is set with 'x. Marks are local to the editor in
which they are set.</p>
<p>Uppercase marks, which should mark a position in a specific file, are
not supported yet.</p>
<p>There are three special marks: "'", ".", and "^". "'" marks the
position from which the last jump was made. "." is where the change was made
. "^" marks the end of the last insert operation. There is also a mark
"`" which is the same as "'".</p>

<p>All marks are motions and can be combined with operators.</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>Vrapper also supports some registers for storing text and operations.
  Please refer to Vim documentation for their use (:help registers)</p>
