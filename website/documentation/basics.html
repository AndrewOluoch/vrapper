<h2>Basics</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The preferred way of installation is to use the Eclipse update site:</p>
<pre>http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/update-site/stable</pre>
<p>If you downloaded a file release, put the jar files contained in the zip file you downloaded in the "plugins" and "features" directories of your eclipse installation.</p>
<p>If the plugin works correctly you will be able to see a "Vim" icon in the toolbar after you start up Eclipse.</p>

<h3>Using the plugin</h3>
<img src="../img/toolbar_button.png" style="float:right;" />
<p>Click the "Vim" button in the toolbar. After that, open a new editor. The plugin will automatically add its functionality to the editor when it is opened. You can now use your favorite Vim commands in the editor (assuming they are implemented).</p>
<p>Click the button again to deactivate the plugin. Note that this will not affect any open editors. The button only controls what happens to editors which are newly opened.</p>
<p>While this may seem a bit confusing at first, it is a simple approach to let users choose which editors should be wrapped by the plugin and which should not. I think it is better than to decide to either have it alter all editors or none.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with this behaviour and have a better idea, feel free to file a feature request.</p>
<p>If you do not like clicking the icon, you can define a keyboard shortcut for the action. Go to Preferences-&gt;General-&gt;Keys and type "vrapper" in the filter. You can the define a shortcut for the "Toggle Vrapper" command.</p>
