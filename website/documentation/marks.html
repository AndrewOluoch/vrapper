<h2>Marks</h2>

<p>Any position in the text may be marked using "mx" where x is a
character from a-z. You can jump to a mark with "`x" and to the begin of
the line where the mark is set with "'x". Marks are local to the editor in
which they are set.</p>
<p>Uppercase marks, which should mark a position in a specific file, are
not supported yet.</p>
<p>There are three special marks: "'", ".", and "^". "'" marks the
position from which the last jump was made. "." is where the change was made
. "^" marks the end of the last insert operation. There is also a mark
"`" which is the same as "'".</p>
<p>All marks are motions and can be combined with operators.</p>
