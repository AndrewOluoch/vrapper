<h2>Search</h2>

<p>Vrapper uses search functionality offered by Eclipse to do the actual search.
You can use "/keyword" or "?keyword" to search for a keyword. "n" jumps to the
next match while "N" jumps to the previous match.</p>

<p>You may also specify search offsets as known from Vim. For example,
"/keyword/e-2" searches for the keyword and then jumps to the "o" of the match.
If the keyword is omitted, like "//b+2", the last keyword is used and only the
offset of the search changes.</p>

<p>Case sensitivity can be controlled via the options <a href="?page=6">ignorecase and smartcase</a>.
Or, you can temporarily override those options by putting '\c' or '\C' anywhere in your search string.
'\c' forces case <b>insensitive</b> for this search, '\C' forces case <b>sensitive</b> for this search.</p>

<p>"*" and "#" commands are also available. These search for an exact match of the word under the cursor.</p>

<p>All search commands (n, N, *, #, /, ?) can be used like motions, i. e. combined with counts and operators.</p>
