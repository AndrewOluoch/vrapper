<h2>Search</h2>

<p>Vrapper uses search functionality offered by Eclipse to do the actual search.
You can use "/keyword" or "?keyword" to search for a keyword. "n" jumps to the
next match while "N" jumps to the previous match.</p>

<p>You may also specify search offsets as known from Vim. For example,
"/keyword/e-2" searches for the keyword and then jumps to the "o" of the match.
If the keyword is omitted, like "//b+2", the last keyword is used and only the
offset of the search changes.</p>

<p>Case sensitivity can be controlled via the options <a href="?page=6">ignorecase and smartcase</a>.
Or, you can temporarily override those options by putting '\c' or '\C' anywhere in your search string.
'\c' forces case <b>insensitive</b> for this search, '\C' forces case <b>sensitive</b> for this search.</p>

<p>"*" and "#" commands are also available. These search for an exact match of the word under the cursor.</p>

<p>All search commands (n, N, *, #, /, ?) can be used like motions, i. e. combined with counts and operators.</p>

<h2>And Replace</h2>
<p>Vrapper supports a couple special cases when performing a search and replace (:s/foo/bar/).
These should all align with the equivalent Vim behavior.</p>

<p>Whatever character appears after the ':s' will be used as the delimiter.
For example, ':s/foo/bar/g' and ':s_foo_bar_g'.</p>

<p>In the replace string, '\r' will be interpreted as a (platform-independent)
newline.  Using '\n' in the replace string will result in the '\n' character
being inserted literally.  This means it may work fine on files with Unix line
endings but if you have Windows line endings '\n' will cause problems.</p>

<p>If the replace string exactly matches '\=@&lt;char&gt;' then the contents of
register &lt;char&gt; will be used for the replacement.  For example,
:s/foo/\=@x/ will replace 'foo' with the contents of register 'x'.</p>

<p>The following flags are supported after the replace string: 'c' (confirm), 'g' (global), 'i' (insensitive case), 'I' (sensitive case)</p>
