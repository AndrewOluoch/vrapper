<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The first part explains why I started writing Vrapper. If you are not interested, you can go right to <a href="#theinterestingstuff">the interesting stuff</a>.</p>

<h3>Reasons for developing Vrapper</h3>
<p>I have been using Eclipse for Java development for a few years now and I am quite happy with a lot of its features. However, before I started using Vim, I was never really satisfied with the editors I used. The various key combinations always feeled a little slow and I tend to hit the wrong keys when my fingers leave the home row.</p>
<p>All this changed, of course, when I learned to use Vim. I had often considered it but in the end never really tried. A few months ago I finally sat down with a small programming task to do and hacked around for a few hours using Vim only. Since then, I did not ever want to use something different.</p>
<p>Now the real challenge came: I still wanted to use an IDE for Java programming, but editing in the Eclipse editor felt clumsy and slow. So I started to search for a plugin which would give me some Vim for my Eclipse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the search turned out to be fruitless. There are two really nice pieces of software out there: <a href="http://vimplugin.org/">Vimplugin</a>, which completely embeds Vim as on OLE component, and <a href="http://eclim.sourceforge.net/">Eclim</a>, which lets you use a GUI-less Eclipse from Vim. But I wanted something that had Vim-like controls while still offering the features of the Eclipse editors, like code assist and refactoring.</p>
<p>There was an Eclipse plugin which seemingly did exactly what I wanted, called the ViPlugin, but it was not free (neither beer nor speech) which I could have accepted, but also lacked a satisfying way to remap keys, which was unacceptable as I had just learned the Dvorak layout back then (and I like my movement keys under my right hand).</p>
<p>So finally I decided to take matters into my own hands and started writing what is now Vrapper. I am really satisfied so far and the editors in Eclipse do not feel clumsy anymore.</p>
<p>Good News! Everyone who actually read through all this ranting gets <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=249013&sel_platform=13839">a free license for Vrapper</a>. :-)</p>

<h3>Targeted Users</h3>
<p>Vrapper is neither able nor intended to be a replacement for Vim and never will be. I still use Vim for all plain text, HTML, JSP, Python and lots of other types of text. But for those Vim/Eclipse users who do not want to miss the features and integration of a powerful Eclipse editor (like the Java editor) Vrapper is a nice compromise.</p>
<p>If you have just started learning Vim, I would recommend to stay with the original for a while before trying Vrapper, especially while it is still beta software, to avoid learning something in Vrapper and then find out that it is not the real Vim behaviour. Plus, you can report more bugs if you know Vim better. ;-)</p>
