<h2>Optional Plugins</h2>
In addition to the standard Vrapper plugin, we have a couple optional plugins
that you can install to further enhance Vrapper's features.  These plugins either have
extra dependencies which everyone might not have installed, or they provide behaviors
which aren't found in Vim.

<h3>CDT, JDT, and PyDev Plugins</h3>
<p>The CDT, JDT, and PyDev plugins access Eclipse features found only in the CDT package (C++ Development Tools)
the JDT package (Java Development Tools), or PyDev package (Python Development).  If you do any C++ development in Eclipse, chances are
you already have CDT installed.  Likewise with JDT for Java development.  The Vrapper CDT plugin has
a dependency on the CDT package, the Vrapper JDT plugin has a dependency on the JDT package,
and the Vrapper PyDev plugin has a dependency on the PyDev package.</p>
<p>Each of these plugins provide the following commands:</p>
<table class="commands">
    <tr><td>gcc</td><td>comment/uncomment current line</td></tr>
	<tr><td>gc&lt;text object&gt;</td><td>comment/uncomment text object</td></tr>
	<tr><td>== </td><td>auto-indent current line (not applicable for PyDev)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>=&lt;text object&gt;</td><td>auto-indent text object (not applicable for PyDev)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Ctrl+]<br/>gd<br/>gD</td><td>go to declaration of object under cursor</td></tr>
	<tr><td>gR</td><td>rename element</td></tr>
	<tr><td>:format</td><td>call underlying language's source code formatter</td></tr>
</table>

<br/>
<p>In addition to this, the JDT plugin also provides these commands:</p>
<table class="commands">
	<tr><td>gr</td><td>activate Eclipse's 'refactor' menu</td></tr>
	<tr><td>gm</td><td>activate Eclipse's 'source' menu</td></tr>
</table>

<br/>
<p>
We are able to define a mapping for any Eclipse operation within
the org.eclipse.cdt.ui.edit.* or org.eclipse.jdt.ui.edit.text.java.*
Eclipse namespaces.  If there are any commands you'd like us to support,
just file an <a href="https://github.com/vrapper/vrapper/issues">Issue</a> on our GitHub project.
</p>

<h3>Surround.vim Plugin</h3>
<p>Surround.vim is a vim plugin defined here:<br>
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697</a><br/>
The Vrapper Surround plugin is a port of this script.  It isn't a complete port, but it
supports a couple of the Surround operations.  The Vrapper Surround plugin works on the
'c', 'd', and 'y' commands. After initiating one of those commands, hit 's' followed by
one of the following characters:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a &lt; &gt;</li>
	<li>b ( )</li>
	<li>B { }</li>
    <li>[ ]</li>
	<li>'</li>
	<li>"</li>
	<li>`</li>
</ul>

<p>For the 'c' command you'll have to select the character that represents what the
text is currently surrounded by then the character you want to replace it with. For
example, cs"( would replace the surrounding double-quotes with parentheses.</p>
